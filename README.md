# Tripping Hazard Detection based on Open-vocabulary Object Detection
# Our contribution
1. We designed an innovative OVOD-based construction site tripping hazard classification framework which avoids time-consuming training processes while showing exceptional robustness and a strong ability to generalize.
2. Extensive experiments were conducted to not only compare our proposed framework with existing classification networks in different experimental settings but also demonstrate the high quality and diversity of our released real construction site dataset.
